#Hangman

Use `git clone` to clone the project in your machine. `cd` in the folder and then run using `python3 hangman.py` on your shell. If you're using IDLE, open the file using IDLE and use `Run Module` feature.

### Todos:

- Game improvements
- Refactor current implementation to allow GUI driven game
- Better word list, hopefully a file with dictionary words
- Implement *keras* and *tenserflow* AI elements

### Contribution:

Contributions are welcome, play around with the code and try implementing some of the todo features. The more you break, the more you learn.

### Got a question? New ideas?

Head over to the [issues](https://github.com/ksu-pi/AI_python/issues) and create a new issue.
